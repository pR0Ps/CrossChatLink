 CrossChatLink
 https://bitbucket.org/pR0Ps/crosschatlink
 
 CrossChatLink is a cross-platform re-implementation of NetChatLink
 <http://netchatlink.sourceforge.net> coded in Python 3.2. Like NetChatLink,
 it is a small application that links chats across multiple DC hubs and IRC
 channels. CrossChatLink is designed to be run as a daemon and is controlled
 solely by commands passed to it via telnet or a DC/IRC connection.
 
 More details to come as the program gets fleshed out.
