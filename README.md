CrossChatLink
=============

https://github.com/pR0Ps/CrossChatLink

CrossChatLink is a cross-platform re-implementation of NetChatLink
<http://netchatlink.sourceforge.net> coded in Python 3.2. Like NetChatLink,
it is a small application that links chats across multiple DC hubs and IRC
channels. CrossChatLink is designed to be run as a daemon and is controlled
solely by commands passed to it via telnet or a DC/IRC connection.
 
More details to come as the program gets fleshed out.
